In most cases,the best way to get to your destination quickly and easily is to travel by plane. In large airlines there is an incredibly large base of planes, and it's impossible to control all of these without the interference of kopms.

Our program will allow you to manage the data on ticket sales and air travel.
That is, the user has the opportunity to create an order for the first flight, to enter information in the database or edit it.

What kind of information can the user enter and what is the database?
The database contains information directly on the aircraft, regular passengers, aircraft flights, airplanes and airports to which these aircraft arrive and depart.
This information can either be entered by the user, or edited by the user.

How to do this we will describe later.
